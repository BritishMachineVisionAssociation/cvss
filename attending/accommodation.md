Accommodation is situated in one of their historic houses on North Bailey, which are far older than their Georgian frontages suggest, some of which are approximately a 5 minute walk from the main college building and heading into town close to restaurants and bars.  Most houses have 3 floors which are accessible by stairs only.

All of their rooms are individual, clean, tastefully decorated and very often contain original features. Tea and coffee-making facilities are provided, as are towels, and rooms are en-suite.

Breakfast is served in the Moulsdale Hall from 08:00 – 09:30. A choice of Full English or Continental style breakfast is available. Their excellent chefs and friendly kitchen staff will be only too happy to help.
