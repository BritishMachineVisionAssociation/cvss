The Poster and Reception will take place at Visualisation Lab in MCS (Mathematical Sciences & Computer Science Building) on Monday 15th of July from 17:00 to 19:00. 

Poster presentation is not mandatory but highly recommended. The session offers the attendees a stage to showcase their research and form potential collaborations. The posters will be judged and there will be prizes.

The posters should be in A1 portrait format. There is no print service available onsite. The attendees are responsible for printing and bringing their posters. Velcro pads and pins will be provided for affixing posters to the display boards.
