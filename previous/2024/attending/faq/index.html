<hr />

<h3 id="q0">What prior experience should attendees have?</h3>
<p>The required background knowledge is what would be covered in a level 3 undergraduate programme, specifically in the areas of computer vision and deep learning. Attendees are expected to know the basics of neural networks, backpropagation, deep learning architectures, computer vision topics like edge features, contours, feature points, stereo vision and similar.</p>

<h3 id="q1">Can you provide details about the accommodation provided?</h3>
<p>All rooms will be single occupancy en-suite rooms (single bedrooms with a private bathroom inside the room). The rooms are in the St. Chad’s College of Durham, which offers Bed and Breakfast type hospitality. You can read more about these in the following link https://www.stchads.ac.uk/commercial/bed-breakfast/</p>

<h3 id="q2">Can I arrive on Sunday?</h3>
<p>Yes! All residential packages include accommodation for the Sunday night. (5 nights, Sunday – Friday)</p>

<h3 id="q3">What time can I arrive at Chad's College accommodation?</h3>
<p>We are working on arranging your arrival information, please hold tight</p>

<h3 id="q4">Can I bring my family or pet?</h3>
<p>For residential accommodation we are unable to provide options for family or pets, all rooms are single occupancy with no pets allowed. Unfortunately, pets are not allowed to have in the university during the summer school or its related events.</p>

<h3 id="q5">I would like to book alternative accommodation, what are some options in Durham?</h3>
<p>Within Durham city centre, which will be within reasonable walking distance from the campus, where the lecture will be held, there is:<br />- <a href="https://www.ihg.com/hotelindigo/hotels/gb/en/durham/mmedh/hoteldetail">Hotel Indigo</a> <br />- <a href="https://www.premierinn.com/gb/en/hotels/england/county-durham/durham/durham-city-centre-walkergate.html?ARRdd=21&amp;ARRmm=05&amp;ARRyyyy=2024&amp;NIGHTS=1&amp;ROOMS=1&amp;ADULT1=1&amp;CHILD1=0&amp;COT1=0&amp;INTTYP1=DB&amp;BRAND=PI">Premier Inn</a><br />- <a href="https://www.radissonhotels.com/en-us/hotels/radisson-blu-durham?cid=a%3Ase+b%3Agmb+c%3Aemea+i%3Alocal+e%3Ardb+d%3Aukirwe+h%3AGBXVU1">Radisson Blu</a><br />- <a href="https://www.marriott.com/en-us/hotels/ncldd-delta-hotels-durham-royal-county/overview/?scid=f2ae0541-1279-4f24-b197-a979c79310b0">Delta<a></a><br />If we go a bit further away, then we have:<br />- <a href="https://www.ramsidehallhotel.co.uk/">Ramside Hall</a><br />- <a href="https://www.lumleycastle.com/">Lumley Castle</a></a></p>

<h3 id="q6">I will need to obtain a UK visa to attend the summer school in Durham. Could you please clarify the sequence of visa processing and registration to avoid any potential delays in either process?</h3>
<p>Firstly, please register for the summer school and make the payment in full. Contact the organisers by email specifying your full name, address and passport issuing nation + passport number. The BMVA will be able to issue you an invitation letter for your attendance at the summer school, confirming your registration, to use within the visa application process. You are then responsible for applying for the appropriate UK entry visa in sufficient time to enable your attendance and the BMVA is unable to offer further assistance with regard to the visa application process itself. Please contact the nearest British Embassy or High Commission in your country or territory of origin for advice and guidance on this process that can differ from nation to nation.</p>

<h3 id="q7">In the event that I am unable to attend the summer school due to visa issues, I would like to inquire about the possibility of a refund of the registration fee.</h3>
<p>If your visa application is not successful, the BMVA will make a full refund of the amount in GBP minus the transaction processing costs incurred by the BMVA (3.9% for international fees (+20% UK VAT)) within 10 days of the request for your refund (pre-event). All refund requests must be received at least 10 days prior to the commencement of the summer school event (i.e. before 5th July 2024). Refund requests received on or after 5th July 2024 will not be processed owing to the contracted costs incurred by the BMVA for accommodation / catering that cannot be unbooked with the associated suppliers in the period less than 10 days before the event.</p>

<h3 id="q8">I'm facing some financial limitations. I was wondering if any fellowships or grant options are available to help cover the costs?</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, there is no additional budget to fund travel and accommodation and the price that is offered now is already subsidised by the British Machine Vision Association.</p>

<h3 id="q9">What size poster should I prepare for the poster session?</h3>
<p>The poster size should be A1 portrait (23.4 x 33.1 inches / 59.4 x 84.1 cm).</p>

<h3 id="q10">Do all students need to bring posters?</h3>
<p>The poster session is not mandatory, however, we greatly encourage students to bring posters to present their work and engage with other attendees. The poster session will allso have a prizes for the best posters!</p>

<h3 id="q11">Is it possible to get parking?</h3>
<p>University parking isn’t easy to arrange please contact us as soon as possible, last minute requests will certainly not be possible. However, there is two Park &amp; Rides near Durham and some areas have free street parking but it is limited.</p>

<h3 id="q12">Can I volunteer to get reduced/free registration?</h3>
<p>Volunteers are by invite only and are usually students from the host university. If you are interested in volunteering and fit the criteria, please contact the organisers. Volunteers do not recieve accommodation (residency). Anyone not invited to be a volunteer who signs up will have their registration cancelled.</p>

<h3 id="q13">Are companies welcome to send staff?</h3>
<p>Yes, companies are welcome to send staff to the summer school. Please note the payment conditions.</p>

<h3 id="q14">Can we pay by invoice?</h3>
<p>Yes, you can pay by invoice. Please contact the organisers for more information. However, registration is only confirmed once payment is received, therefore payment should be processed immediately and we can not obide by 30/60/90/etc. day payment periods.</p>
