  - question: I will need to obtain a UK visa to attend the summer school in Durham. Could you please clarify the sequence of visa processing and registration to avoid any potential delays in either process?"
    answer: "Firstly, please register for the summer school and make the payment in full. Contact the organisers by email specifying your full name, address and passport issuing nation + passport number. The BMVA will be able to issue you an invitation letter for your attendance at the summer school, confirming your registration, to use within the visa application process. You are then responsible for applying for the appropriate UK entry visa in sufficient time to enable your attendance and the BMVA is unable to offer further assistance with regard to the visa application process itself. Please contact the nearest British Embassy or High Commission in your country or territory of origin for advice and guidance on this process that can differ from nation to nation."
  - question: "In the event that I am unable to attend the summer school due to visa issues, I would like to inquire about the possibility of a refund of the registration fee."
    answer: "If your visa application is not successful, the BMVA will make a full refund of the amount in GBP minus the transaction processing costs incurred by the BMVA (3.9% for international fees (+20% UK VAT)) within 10 days of the request for your refund (pre-event). All refund requests must be received at least 10 days prior to the commencement of the summer school event (i.e. before 5th July 2024). Refund requests received on or after 5th July 2024 will not be processed owing to the contracted costs incurred by the BMVA for accommodation / catering that cannot be unbooked with the associated suppliers in the period less than 10 days before the event."
  - question: "I'm facing some financial limitations. I was wondering if any fellowships or grant options are available to help cover the costs?"
    answer: "Unfortunately, there is no additional budget to fund travel and accommodation and the price that is offered now is already subsidised by the British Machine Vision Association."
  - question: "What size poster should I prepare for the poster session?"
    answer: "The poster size should be A1 portrait (23.4 x 33.1 inches / 59.4 x 84.1 cm)."

    answer: "Volunteers are by invite only and are usually students from the host university. If you are interested in volunteering and fit the criteria, please contact the organisers.
