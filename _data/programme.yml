    bio: "Dr Pascal Mettes is an Assistant Professor at the University of Amsterdam. Pascal and his team focus on deep learning in hyperbolic space. Within deep learning, we tend to question all aspects of training neural networks, from architectures and optimization to data and tricks. The most fundamental assumption, namely to operate in Euclidean space, is however rarely questioned. We believe that opening our scope beyond Euclid opens an entirely new worlds for deep learning. Specifically, Pascal focuses on hyperbolic deep learning. Learning in hyperbolic space enables us to learn hierarchical representations, with stronger robustness (with respect to OOD and adversarial samples), more compactness, and with the possibility of incorporating prior knowledge. His team also considers it the native space for vision-language models. In Pascal’s lab, they are therefore spearheading hyperbolic deep learning through algorithmic advances, open-source developments, and international workshops, tutorials, and talks."
