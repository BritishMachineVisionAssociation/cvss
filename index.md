## Reflecting on the 28th BMVA Summer School

From the 7th - 11th of July 2025, the University of Aberdeen was proud to host the 28th BMVA Computer Vision Summer School. We welcomed a vibrant cohort of students and researchers from across the globe for an intensive week of learning, collaboration, and innovation. The programme featured engaging lectures from world-renowned academics and industry leaders, hands-on practical sessions, and invaluable networking opportunities. A particular highlight was the poster competition, which showcased the exceptional quality of research being undertaken by our attendees. We extend our sincere gratitude to our speakers, sponsors, and participants for making this year's event an unforgettable success and contributing to a wonderfully stimulating atmosphere.
